<p class="lead">This page consists of quotes from Don Rosa himself on himself, his duck stories and ducks in general. It's composed by Harry Fluks out of messages sent from Don Rosa to the mailing list on Disney comics (up to July 10th, 1994), and then adapted for WWW by Per Starb√§ck.</p>

<H2><A NAME="address">Don's Address</A></H2>
I have little fear of being swamped by fan mail... particularly
when I'm situated in America where anyone who reads Disney comics is
considered a pariah by the average American comic-collector-cretin.
Here -- I'll prove it:

> Don Rosa;  9711 Dawson Hill Rd.; Louisville, KY; 40299<BR>
> Phone: (502)2313399.<BR>

So there.

<H2><A NAME="background">Don's Background</A></H2>
My ancestors are from Italy. In fact my father was born there,
in a small village at the foot of the Alps called (I think) Montiago
or Moniago or something like that. My grandfather's name was Gioachino
which no one in America could pronounce, so they called him Chino which
became spelled "Keno" which is the name I was given. My grandmother was
from Venice; her name was Chilistina Titiano, and claimed direct lineage
to/from Titian, having proof in documents which have since been lost.
There are still lots of Rosas in north Italy (I'm the last Rosa in America)
and I hope to visit there someday...

<P> What did I do before Ducks? My B.A. is in civil engineering and
I owned a construction company which was passed on to me from my father
and grandfather who established it when he came to America in 1905.

<H2><A NAME="predisney">Don's Pre-Disney Comics</A></H2>
<H3>About Lance Pertwillaby</H3>
I found that the same plots featuring Lance that people cared
nothing for became VERY popular when I put the Ducks in them. That's
the sort of knowledge that will always help me remember "my place".
It's the DUCKS that make me popular.
<P> I plan on turning ALL those stories into Duck stories eventually
at which time they'll be improved with slightly (but not much) better
art and NO ROSA LETTERING.

<H2><A NAME="work">Don's Working Methods</A></H2>
Since I never intended to become a professional comic booker,
I never made any investigation of what standard materials or practices
are for the industry -- I suspect NOTHING I do is done the way anyone
else does it, so I always warn people to not put the slightest bit of
value on anything I tell them I do, how I do it or the tools I use.
I've just made it all up on my own and I have no notion of how it's
supposed to be done. I'm sure there are much better methods, as my results
and the time it takes for me to achieve even THEM attests.
<P> Actually, Egmont dictates the size of my originals, which is
okay by me, except maybe that they have me draw rather large, which only
means I'll take that much more time to fit in more detail. I do each
page in two halves, each half being about 12.5" X 9" (whatever that is
in the metric system I use), making a full page about 12.5" X 18".
<P> "Tools" are my biggest area of ignorance. If I knew what I was
doing, I'd have learned how to use a single brush such as Van Horn might
use. Instead, all I know are pens. I use up to EIGHT pens (and brushes)
on EACH PANEL. I start with a calligraphy pen (which gives me line
variation in a single stroke) for the "close-up" (thick lined) stuff,
then an italics pen (same wedge tip as the C. pen, only smaller), then a
"drawing" pen (plain tip), then two sizes of Rapid-O-graph (technical)
pens for straight lines and templated things. Then a speed-ball to fill
in the small black areas, then a medium brush to fill in larger black
areas, then a tiny brush to spend about a half-hour on each page WHITING
OUT lots of mistakes, evening out the ends of cross-hatching, and
blotting out whole vistas of needless and irritating detail that you
never even see.
<P> I use stacks of templates and curves. Templates are those plastic
sheets with all sorts and sizes of circles, ellipses, ovals and such.
I use these WHENEVER I can, often doing a large part of each page just
with these "mechanical drawing" tools -- undoubtedly my engineering degree
showing. For example, with templates I ink all nephew heads, all eyes
and eyeballs, $crooge's glasses and the upper portion of his top hat,
all buttons, nephew's hats, and even their feet and bills in certain
angles. That's just the DUCKS themselves -- naturally anything else in
every panel that involves a circle or angle-view of same, or any gentle
curve like a motion line, ALL this will I ink meticulously with technical
equipment! Obviously, this is not the technique of a normal cartoonist --
it's the technique of an insane person.
<P> I simply ink in empty balloons. The size I make the balloons is
guess-work -- my instructions are to generously estimate the balloon
size for English (this will accomodate most languages) then ADD one full
line for Finnish (this is called the Finnishing Touch). But the balloons
you see on my stories in Gladstone comics are NOT MINE, and the art around
the edges of the balloons is NOT MINE. Somebody has always whited out
those extra large balloons (using stats), redrawn smaller ones and
finished the art in around the smaller balloons. I am very grateful for
the trouble they take to make my stories look nice by eliminating the
big, bulky balloons.
<P> Most of the needless and irritating detail is done in the
pencil stage. On the other hand, some of what I feel are my best gags do
not appear in my scripts, but leap off my pencil as I draw without my
seeming to think about it. Actually, my scripts usually contain only
plot and dialogue -- it's not until I draw the stuff that the stories
become funny simply because I don't take my stories seriously. The humor
is almost an afterthought.
<P> I hope to draw a page a day. That doesn't mean I pencil
and then ink one page at a time. But while I pencil I try to do 4
half-pages per day, and later INK that same amount -- this then averages
one full page per day. However, with the type of stuff I do, I NEVER
seem to meet that goal; this $#@%*&amp; Croesus story I just did with
ancient temples with 127 fluted columns, took much longer -- only 3
half-pages per day, adding many extra days to the job.

<H2><A NAME="jw">HDL Junior Woodchucks</A></H2>
Ranks in the Junior Woodchucks are so ever-changing that I
don't think HD&amp;L have the same rank in any two stories. In a recent
"Life of $crooge", I showed him meeting the first three Woodchucks and
tried drawing their hats with the tails at the bottom -- but I turned
the hats into "exalted highttails" since the hats just don't LOOK right
to me without the tails on the top. I see ALL JW caps now as being the
"hightail" style... checking Barks stories will prove that.

<H2><A NAME="dates">Birth And Death Dates Of The Ducks, Coots And McDucks</A></H2>
I try to list the birth/death dates from my notes. I see that
I did not mess around with the fringes of the tree yet -- therefore,
I never made any notes concerning Fanny or Gus; there wasn't much going
on in that branch, so the dates didn't matter much as long as I knew which
generation they each belonged in. Of these other characters, the dates
are sometimes partially given in "The Old Castle's Secret" as regarding
the McDuck ancestors. Other dates are exact when there was a need to be,
otherwise I didn't get fancy and I just used 5 year increments, 1920,
1925, 1930 and so on. (I wouldn't say 1921 if there was no specific
reason to since I knew I might still change a date here or there someday
for some reason. If a date ends in a blank, that means I figure the
character lived well past 1967. If a date ends in a "19??", that means
I don't know when the critter died, but they must surely be as cold as
a carp by 1970!

<H2><A NAME="time">Time In Don's Stories</A></H2>
I maintain (as more a private bit of knowledge than anything
else) that my stories take place in the early-mid... sometimes late 50's.
However, I am well aware of times that certain things in the background
might violate that SLIGHTLY -- and so far it has been in the form of
satellites in two different stories; the ones in "The Duck Who Fell
to Earth" and a Brutopian "Sputnik" in "The Curse of Nostrildamus". I
always draw them as 1957 style Rooski Sputniks (and in fact called that
one same), so I think a satellite here and there doesn't violate my time
frame. However, OTHER things do, such as there being LOTS of satellites
in orbit in "Duck...Fell...", a weather satellite with a camera being
used by a TV weatherman in that same story (the gag wasn't worth it, so
I shoulda lost that'n), and some reference to a giant hamburger chain a
la McDonald's in the second tale I ever did (which I can't recall the
title of!).

<P> I do not see my stories taking place in chronological order unless
they are stated as such in internal references. We've been reading reprints
for decades -- and that's sorta my whole idea of setting my tales in
the 50's... I like to imagine them as reprints from the very years when
I was reading those comics. There is a tremendous amount of lil' hidden
tidbits in the stories; one detail that pinpointed the year a story was
taking place was a ledger on page one of "Last Sled to Dawson" which
read "1954"... and I think I did the same thing with some ledger books
in "Cash Flow".

<H2><A NAME="nonduck">Don About Doing Non-Duck Comics</A></H2>
If I couldn't do Uncle $crooge comics, I wouldn't do some other
comics, I'd go back into the construction business. I have no interest
in doing "my own" characters since they do not exist and I have no
sentimental attachment to them. I didn't grow up on some characters I
might invent next week. $crooge and Donald have been part of my entire
life. I'm stuck with that.


<P> As for me ever doing a Mickey Mouse story, there's no chance of
that. There's no reason for me to. I am totally apathetic toward the
character as being simply a cute configuration of lines. There's no
personality. Sure, in the hands of another Barks, Mickey would become
a WONDERFUL character. Look what he did with Donald... all he got from
Disney was a slapstick hothead who threw walnuts at Chip n' Dale.
What Dell/Barks did with the character is a miracle. I'll be glad to
do a Mickey Mouse story after someone else writes and draws classic
Mickey comics for 25 years and gets me interested in those cute ink
lines. As of right now... feh.

<H2><A HREF="#">AR 102</A>, "The Son of the Sun"</H2>
<H3>About D.U.C.K. dedications, "Dedicated to Unca Carl from Keno"</H3>
When did I start putting my "D.U.C.K." dedication in my comics?
It was in the last panel of the first one I did, "The Son of the Sun"...
but Gladstone removed it since it looked as if it might be a signature.
However, when they used that story in certain foreign countries, you can
see the dedication still there. 
<P> That dedication has been in every story I've ever done, in the
splash (first) panel after the first 2 stories... but early on at both
Gladstone and Egmont the editors removed it. Now that I hide it and have
explained what it is, it is no longer removed. I also started putting it
on the covers as well, beginning with the covers I did for Disney Comics
a few years ago.

<P> Another detail that shows that my stories are out of chronological
order (not the "Life of" stories, of course - they're IN order) was in
my very first comic "The Son of the Sun" where one exhibit in the McDuck
show was for the treasure of Croesus -- a treasure that $crooge once
dreamed of, but never was shown to find. That treasure is perhaps one of
the MOST famous in history, and I have planned to do the search for it
since 1987.

<H2><A HREF="#">AR 103</A>, "Nobody's Business"</H2>
The "D.U.C.K." dedication was in the LAST panel of "Nobody's
Business" -- in the first two stories I ever did I put it in the last,
rather than first, panel... and it was left in that story since it
looked like the title on a comic book on the floor.

<P> I have NO fond memories of that story -- I think it was quite a
come-down from "SotS", very forced and contrived. But as to those
comics [Gladstone reads] -- you notice there were no Disney DUCK comics?
That was to show my idea that in the Duck Universe, Mickey Mouse and the
other non-Duck characters are simply fictitious comic characters... only
the Ducks are "real".

<H2><A HREF="#">AR 116</A>, "Rocket Reverie"</H2>
The art on "Rocket Reverie" [in Gladstone Album #28] restored
some details omitted from the first use.

<H2><A HREF="#">AR 128</A>, "Fortune on the Rocks"</H2>
That was one I did before the concept that my stuff was being
seen in Europe far more than in America had really sunk into my skull --
and that story is jammed with untranslatable puns. It must be murder to
translate since so many scenes are built around exchanges of dialogue
that culminate in a pun and nothing else. Whew!

<H2><A HREF="#">AR 130</A>,  "Return to Plain Awful"</H2>
I'd originally imagined that "Return to Plain Awful" took
place in 1950, shortly after the original (they were returning those
chickens)... but I guess I screwed up because I made references to
"Son of the Sun" which had to have taken place much later, considering
all those museum exhibits. Ahhhh, sue me.

<H2><A HREF="#">H 85218</A>, "Well-Educated Duck"</H2>
I only did some stuff for Oberon in between jobs at Gladstone.
They don't produce a fraction of the amount of stuff as does world-
spanning Egmont, so there was much more work (and better pay) for me
at Egmont. The Dutch weren't too thrilled with my art, to their credit...
Anyway, they must have some Dutch readers who like my weird-looking
art since they always reprint everything I produce for Egmont.

<H2><A HREF="#">H 8968</A>, "On a Silver Platter"</H2>
That "On a Silver Platter" was (in my opinion) my very best
10-page gag story!


<P> The first page of "On a Silver Platter": that was one I did
years ago for Oberon who don't like my art; they had one of their
artists pencil page one for me to show me how to do it. I recall they
re-penciled two $crooge heads later in the story because they disliked
mine so much, which I then inked. And I may not be proud of much about
the way I draw Duck stories, but I do like the way I draw Duck HEADS
and expressions.

<H2><A HREF="#">Story for DuckTales Magazine (script only)</A></H2>
My DUCKTALES magazine story was a shortie about Magica
sending $crooge's mansion with herself back into the Jurassic (I
guess) era until he tosses his Dime out to her. I'm even pretty vague on
the details now, but I think he tosses it over to a certain spot so that
when she grabs it and returns the mansion and grounds to the present,
she's standing where the pool is and falls in and they grab her,
ta da. I recall how they screwed it up proper in several ways... one of
which is a throw-away gag in the first panel where $crooge says "What's
that TREMOR running through the house?" and some dull-witted character
pointing to a tiny mouse saying "That's a MOUSE!" No big yuk, but the
gag was rewritten into "The whole house is shaking!" "That mouse is
shaking it!" These tiny imbecilities by editors are what drives people
like me nuts!
<P> WHY did I "stoop" to do this job? I had just lost my job with
Gladstone when Disney told them not to return my artwork (reducing my
income to about $10,000 per year which I couldn't get by on). I needed
WORK. And when they called, I still originally refused the idea of doing
a DUCKTALES story OR writing something that someone else would draw. But
they were paying a LOT for that simple-mined drek, so I did a story. I
figured on doing a few more, but I had trouble getting them to PAY; so
after I complained a few times, they paid me, and then went to someone
else for the next script. I was spared further debasement!

<H2><A HREF="#">KD 0190</A>, "The Money Pit"</H2>
If the art looks odd, perhaps that's because that was the first
story I'd drawn in about a year -- that was the first thing I'd done since
Disney had effectively forced me to quit doing comics for Gladstone in
early '89. And if the faces had more "angst"... perhaps it was because
the theme of that story (concerning the mentality of "collectibles
profiteers") was a rather sour and serious matter with me.


<P> Yes, $crooge's Money Bin has been dumped, converted to bills,
moved, and utterly destroyed in many stories, a few of which *I* did.
But in spite of how I view certain historical aspects of Barks' stories
as set-in-stone (and I seek to set-into-Impervium with my series), there
are other aspects of the Ducks that I do not regard or treat with such
solid conviction. Though I always insist that the Bin looks exactly the
same and is always on the same hill (something Barks changed
constantly), on t'other hand, no matter HOW many times it is emptied or
converted or destroyed, by the next story I choose to disregard that as
a non-fact and treat the Bin as having never been disturbed since it was
first built and filled. Maybe my frame of reference is that anything
that happened before "current times" is hard fact; anything that happens
in a new story is forgotten by the next story, as if it never occured.
This might be one way to explain my attitude that time in Duckburg
stopped moving forward around 1955. I keep telling stories on a 1955
slate, then wiping it clean for another 1955 story. 

<H2><A HREF="#">D 90147</A>, "On Stolen Time"</H2>
I did not FORGET that the air molecules would have been frozen
in my "On Stolen Time" story; I chose to IGNORE the fact in order
to tell the tale. I later decided that saying something else other than
time-freezing was going on would have solved that problem (and not been
so silly an idea).


<P> As for my "Frozen Time" story, if I froze time (!) I needed to
freeze it solid, not semi-solid... otherwise it would have been WAY too
close to John D. MacDonald's short-story "The Girl, the Gold Watch and
Everything" (which was made into two TV movies some years back). I had
my idea before I learned of that novelette, but read it to see how close
my idea was to MacDonald's tale. In his story, objects could be moved
slowly, and the moving through air was like moving through water (in
real time) to the guy with the magic watch.

<H2><A HREF="#">D 90314</A>, "Return to Xanadu"</H2>
It took me two days to think of a set-up by which the Ducks could
trigger the flooding of Tralla La, enter the valley, then be unable to
get back to the flood-trigger. Making the story work in these cases is
exactly like putting together a jigsaw puzzle; I have the pieces but I
can't see how they can fit together.


<P> I don't mind if someone says that they don't care for my art
or my writing, or that they prefer some others to me (I'll sooner agree
than disagree with that sort of stuff); but I really dislike hearing
that people think I do sequels to Barks stories as some sort of
short-cut... It's as if they think that when I do a story making a
reference to one of Barks' classics, well, 75% of the job is already
done for me and I can just coast from there. In truth, it's just the
opposite -- doing those sequels is far more DIFFICULT than just making
up an entirely new tale. Rather than most of my work being done for me
and me depending on Barks, those stories being sequels causes me at
least 25-50% MORE work to accomplish. The tales that take me the
longest are things like "Return to Xanadu" when I sat for 2 days
straight at one point trying to figure some way to get a plot to
work within Barks' limits that would still be new and entertaining
without completely screwing and insulting the original concept. Simply
making use of the Trala La setting didn't provide me with anything but
a springboard - and one that may have even sent me further away from
the pool rather than into it.

<H2><A HREF="#">D 91076</A>, "Super Snooper Strikes Again"</H2>
The art was flipped in America for reasons I'm not sure of. I
don't recall which way they flipped it but it might have involved the
fact that certain types of action should always, to my mind also, be
directed certain ways. For instance, if $crooge is marching off into
some unexplored jungle, that should be to the right, into "unexplored
regions" to our eyes. When he returns it should be by marching left.
Otherwise he would seem to be marching back into the section of the
comic we've already read and it would "feel" wrong to our mind's eye.

<H2><A HREF="#">D 91249</A>, "Of Ducks and Dimes and Destinies"</H2>
[1993:]
    There is the 15 page "Of Ducks and Dimes and Destinies" which
I did over 2 years ago, but which is being delayed since it covers much
the same ground as the first chapter of the "Life" series; they should
be able to use that soon, I'd think.

<H2><A HREF="#">D 91192</A>, "War of the Wendigo"</H2>
About the banning of my "War of the Wendigo", my sequel to
"The Land of the Pygmy Indians". [...]
It was
banned by a Disney official because ALL THE INDIANS LOOKED ALIKE
which the guy considered to be an insulting stereotype. And yes, this
means that Barks' original Peeweegah story ALSO can never again be
used in American comic books.
<P> Therefore, simply because I feel very anxious for THIS
PARTICULAR story to see print in English, due to the loads of extra work
I put into the Peeweegah's Longfellowian dialogue, I offered to REDRAW
all the Peeweegahs (except the Chief). I'm not sure how to make them all
different... or how to explain to readers why the Peeweegahs don't look
like they're supposed to... but we'll make that offer, and if that was
the problem, we'll get that story into America, if in a censored form.
Censored is better than nothing?

<H2><A NAME="los">The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck (Lo$, 12-part series)</A></H2>
The whole series is LOTS of fun for me, but I'm not sure if it
isn't a colossal mistake; but I was "forced" into it when I was told
that Disney Comics was going to undertake such a series, [...]
I knew somebody had to beat them to it -- not necessarilly ME, but just
SOMEBODY. I tried to get as much input from as many people as possible
before I began the series... and I just hope my fellow Barks fans
either like it or forgive me for it.


<P> The EARLIEST stories or versions of characters can be excused
from the canon. As we all know, $crooge was originally only intended
as a one-shot character, then as only a minor supporting character...
"the rest is history". While doing my "Life of $crooge" series I have
found it necessary to ignore a bare minimum of Barks' $crooge facts.
I ignore the existance of the "magic hourglass" as being antithesis to
everything $crooge is (as is the fraudulent idea of a "lucky" #1 Dime).
I ignore the story of $crooge having natives roughed up (as well as the
dates in that story). I ignore the date on the calendar in the flashback
in "North of the Yukon" as being one year too late. And I think I
ignore some date pertaining to that "Ghosttown Railroad" story as being
10 years too early to be possible. Not only do I not ignore any other
facts, but the thing that I hope Barks fans will find amazing is that
I incorporate ALL of them... every detail of $crooge's past life, no
matter how tiny the fact was or how buried it was in the third sentence
of the sixth panel of an obscure story, it's ALL incorporated into my
series, set into granite forevermore, all available in one tale. (pant
pant pant)
<P> And as for MY stories, the world that the Ducks live in IS
the real world in every detail (except that the people have black
noses). I never make up silly names for cities, and I never use
half-accurate gag names for historical figures. I have $crooge meet
REAL folks in his early life, and he lives in the real world of 1867-1947
with all places and dates absolutely 100% accurate. No screwing around!
It's all real.
<P> (Only the DUCKTALES stories are imaginary. I'd love to do a story
where DUCKTALES is an unauthorized TV series in Duckberg based on
$crooge's life, and $crooge must sue the creators of the show for slander.)


<P> I don't know about Gladstone, but when they publish an album of
these chapters in Norway, they've already requested to use the "lost
scripts"... there are the equivalent of about 3 full stories that Byron
Erickson rejected. I wouldn't mind people seeing these to see what
stinker stories they might have been inflicted with if not for Byron'
s editing.


<P> In order to explain the Money Bin as being the cash that
$crooge earned himself as he trapsed the globe, I decided the Bin
had to have been built about 50 years before it was first shown
in that WDC&amp;S issue. So I ignore that one tale, at least the parts
of it that suggest the Bin is "new". I also ignored that "corn crib"
tale; yes, it's an excellent story, but you'll hafta agree it's
only a "fable".

<H2><A HREF="#">D 91308</A> (Lo$ 1),
    "The Last of the Clan McDuck"</H2>
I did need to tell the story of $crooge earning the #1 dime,
and before I decided what that tale might be, I at least LOOKED at
that boring old Strobl/? tale and saw the bit where he's a shoeshine
boy chipping mud off a ditchdigger's boots. I feel no obligation to
stick to anything in a non-Barks story... BUT $crooge as a shoeshine
boy as his first job seemed quite appropo, so I stuck with it.
<P> The trick was coming up with a reason for him to be paid with
an American dime when he would still have been in Scotland.

<hr />

<P> Like everyone else, $crooge and Donald and HD&amp;L have always
spoken in my mind with normal voices. But I was forced to deal with this
accent stuff in my "Life of $crooge" series; in part 1 I have $crooge's
family speaking with heavy accents, and $crooge speaking with a slight
accent. But I show that at age 13 he leaves Scotland and grows up as a
globetrotter, mostly in the English speaking areas of America,
Australia, South Africa, Canada, and such. The adult $crooge has NO
Scottish accent.

<H3>[page 2, panel 3:]</H3>
The caption box needed to be reduced because Byron Erickson
had rewritten my caption (with my approval) AFTER I did the art
(including the caption box); in my version, Pa McDuck wasn't the
speaker of the early captions, and that particular box ended in
saying something like "but the solitude is disturbed by two visitors
to the clan cemetary this day". When Gladstone shrank the box they
extended the lower panel, spreading the art. And the reason it caught
my eye as looking very odd is that there was a section of foreground
that was BLANK. I knew that I would NEVER leave a blank space without
filling it with needless and irritating detail!

The bit with the mention of the "13th century" followed by
"1675" (and later by saying that it had been "200 years" since the
Hound) -- that one stumps me! I guess the previous European translators
had all corrected that error without pointing it out to anyone. I looked
at my original script just now, and I see where I have "1475" erased and
"1675" written in, and I failed to correct the "13th century" part. But
how did I decide on one or the other? That answer is lost during the 3
years since I wrote that chapter. I checked Barks' story and, at a
glance, I don't see any mention of year. Maybe I'll study this and
figure out why I decided to change it to 1675... and we'll correct that
for the future album reprint.

I changed $crooge's attire slightly from that old Barks tale --
$crooge would not have had his glasses or his spats in 1880. Also, the
lettering of the riverboat names didn't match the old story either, but
big deal.
<P> I just noticed that Egmont must have removed the
manufacturer's name from the plate on safe aboard the Drennan Whyte...
I should've known this and had Gladstone replace it: "Oso Safe Co.",
just like $crooge used later.

It is stated in "Lost in the Andes" that Rhutt Betler died
as he left Plain Awful. I have very little excuse to have screwed
up on that point. I think that my adult reading of that story was
shaded by my understanding of it as I read it as a child -- so,
even though it's pretty obvious that the vicuna hunter is referring
to Betler, I think I always had it in my head that he was referring
to a DIFFERENT visitor to Plain Awful. Strangely, not a soul among
the many Duck experts who have read my tale ever spotted that goof
until I received a letter from a reader in Sweden after it was printed.
<P> When the story is printed again in Germany or the US, the goof
can be easilly remedied by having the old guy be the professor who
bought the eggs from the Cuzco padre; this has two problems though: if
it ISN'T the REAL Rhutt Betler there's not much point to the whole
scene -- also, why did they forget between 1882 and 1949 that those
stones were eggs. (That latter matter is easilly explained. Often
museums file away stuff and forget what it is.)

<hr />

<P> Wouldn't you say [T. Roosevelt] was the IDEAL person
in all of history that $crooge could have gotten inspiration from?! And
when my research told me that he and $crooge were in the Badlands at the
exact same time, it was irresistably obvious to base the tale on.

<hr />

<P> As for that scenery, there are sections of the Dakota Badlands
that include all of the elements I used in the backgrounds. But they
occur NOWHERE all TOGETHER as I depict them, particularly in that
half-page shot. That was the ol' artistic license.

<hr />

<P> Disney is requiring Gladstone to alter the art on pages 3 and
4 to remove the guns being pointed in $crooge's face. Apparently it's
okay to show guns, but they can only be used for shooting into the
ceiling to get people's attention or something. I think they'll take
the photostat art and twist the gun hands to point the guns upward
rather than Duckward. I really don't object to this -- maybe it's
such a tiny change as to be silly?

<hr />

<P> I know duckbilled dinosaurs had no teeth. I pointed
this out to both Erickson and Clark, saying that I wanted an evil
looking skull, but liked the duck-bill gag... and they both opted to
leave it all as is. Besides... *I* never said that was a duck-billed
dinosaur; T.R. said it was. So... he was wrong. Write to him in care of
Mount Rushmore.

The various publishers are not using my titles, all of which

Part 4 of the "Life" series, "The King of the Copper Hill", will be
titled differently when Gladstone uses it; perhaps "The Flash in the
Copper Pan" or "The Raider of the Copper Hill", so that I can then change
the title of part 8 to "The King of the Klondike" (its current title is

THEY would delete it. Nobody deleted it and it was published in all

MM... but I don't mean to be that disrespectful to poor MM.

<P> Chapter 6 will show U$'s first encounter with a young
Flintheart, though he never learns his NAME, as he did not recall him
when they meet in "The Second Richest Duck". In that story it can be

encounter. He seems to be expecting U$ when he shows up at his door
in South Africa.

    "The Guardians of the Lost Library"</H2>
My adventure done for Norway's "Year of the Book" is titled
"Guardians of the Lost Library". It's a bit preachy since it was done
to fill a certain "educational" need, as was that "War of the Wendigo"
story. I was afraid it read like "Donald and the Wheel" or something,
but some folks have said it's my "best story". In Norway they gave
away the ending of the story on the COVER! That's a lil' bit irritating
for a writer to see, y'knowwhatimean?

<hr />

<P> I KNEW rats would not eat paper, but the editors felt that I
was wrong in saying that they ever printed books on parchment. So, even
though I would have to go back and check my research to see where I
found that they were able to make parchment thin enough for printing, at
least the idea that the books were printed on paper in that story was
the editor's change and not my words.

<H3>About the USA version</H3>
There were a number of changes in the dialogue, but nothing
major as I recall. The rest of it was changes in dialogue and art
needed to add the major bit about the Woodchuck emblem which was
always to be lost to any but the American audience (small as it is)
due to there not BEING a Woodchuck emblem outside the U.S. --  or
if there is, not the "J.W.W." emblem which my story involved.
<P> The other new art involved correcting the Marco Polo error
Stefan Dios pointed out. What this involved was some changes in
dialogue and omitting of two panels on page 13, shifting all the
panel tiers up one on 13-15, then two new panels for page 15 where
I simply moved the Marco Polo reference.

<H3>[]</H3>
Also, when I changed the dialogue, I replaced Marco Polo's
contribution to the Library (until later) by a reference that
travelling scholars had contributed the great books of the libraries
of Islam to the Library while it was in Constantinople (although I'm
not sure the Constantinople Christians would have liked that idea...
maybe they were only secular writings); somebody on here [the mailing
list] was mentioning I should have done that in the story, and now
I dood it.

<H3>[]</H3>
Gladstone took a line in "GotLL" where I used the term
"technicolor yawn" (an admittedly modern bit of soft-grossness that
I really figured the translators would change) and Disney insisted
it be changed to "BARF" -- making ME look like the first person to
use the lovely word "barf" in a Disney comic!
<P> Well, though I'm still astounded Disney would choose such
crass language, I always wondered why they found "barf" nicer than my
phrase. The answer is so obvious! "Technicolor" is a COPYWRITED TERM!
And a company whose MAIN business is making MOVIES had better not screw
around with the misuse of motion picture trademarks of rival production
companies!

<H3>[]</H3>
When I wrote the story, I was confused on the issue of WHO
was the story's main character. Was it a DD story or an U$ story?
It must have been a DD story since it opened with DD; but U$ was the
obvious star and therefore needed to be the subject of the close. I
finally had the idea of sneaking in a last throw-away gag back with DD.
But I never realized that Europe would make it a HD&amp;L story -- I didn't
know that was an option.

About these 3-part stories I'm now doing: I do them in such a

can present them as single-part stories. This means I do two half-pages

you have some "lost pages" to look forward to (if you're bored!) when
Gladstone uses the stuff.

    "The Billionaire of Dismal Downs"</H2>
In this chapter, as well as ALL the chapters in this series,
it is SO tricky to get the whole thing to work properly. The idea of
having $crooge's father die at the end of this chapter is a simple
idea in itself... but how to pull it off properly is something else.
Usually I'll know all the aspects that must be... such as he must die in
his sleep, yet $crooge should never know that before he leaves (mostly to
avoid a "scene" much too grim for a Disney comic, even allowing what I did
go with), plus he must be shown to have a chance at a final goodbye with a
character who can't be alive at that point.

<hr />

<P> I show Jake McDuck all through the "Life of $crooge" series,
but he just sorta disappears along the line. By the last chapter he would
be dead, as would all the other McDucks except $crooge. Naturally I
don't show or speak of ALL these deaths -- but I DO deal with the deaths
of both $crooge's mother and father in scenes unlike ANYTHING that
have ever been in a Disney funnybook.

<hr />

<P> As for whether Jake McDuck was alive at the time of "Christmas
for Shacktown"... no. $crooge knew that, that's why he saw right through
Donald's disguise and gave him the bum's rush. That's my story and I'm
stickin' to it.

<H3>The part about how $crooge got his coat</H3>
I was hampered by the "facts" and how to fit them together
logically. I knew $crooge got his broadcloth coat at a rummage shop
in Scotland in 1902; he had to be a billionaire at that point. Why
would he have needed to buy a coat at a rummage shop when he had been
wealthy for 4 years? Why such a cheap coat? A used coat? And it had
to happen at exactly that point in the story -- any later would have
interfered with the main plot. THAT was how I fit those puzzle pieces
together.

<hr />

<P> My favorite part was when $crooge's sisters were teasing him
about the lock of hair in his safety deposit box, and getting him
rattled while he was trying to ignore them. Seldom does one of my own
bits make me chuckle each time I read it, but I thought this scene was
kinda cute. No. I did not say "cute"!

<hr />

<P> When they reprint that at Gladstone, I need to write into my
accompanying text some sort of explanation to prevent some readers
misunderstanding that story's climax. I have gotten a few comments
from overseas that they were offended by my attempts to "turn $crooge
into another American super-hero", which would be the most repugnant
idea I can imagine. In the first 9 chapters I try to show $crooge
becoming a figure of legendary bravery, cunning and strength -- to
show what the world's greatest Duck was like at the PEAK of his life,
which would have been when he struck gold in the Yukon. I show him
having the strength of several Ducks his size -- or the strength of
the biggest dog/man. BUT... my text accompanying the scene in chapter
9 - part 3 when $crooge tears up Soapy Slick's riverboat was meant to
say that I was showing the LEGEND of that day, NOT the fact. I didn't
mean that $crooge was ACTUALLY doing the things shown in that
sequence... but, as always, I never know what the translators do to
me text that might sabotage my true intent.

<H2><A HREF="#">D 93287</A>, "From Duckburg to Lillehammer"</H2>
That calculus equation has a "=" where a "-" should be! I must
have not been careful while inking my pencils! I'm going to see if
it's possible to catch this before it's printed in Europe!

<hr />

<P> I wasn't "forced" to do that Olympics story, but it was
requested, naturally, by the Norwegian editor who is one of the
nicest people I've ever met and to whom I am greatly obliged for all
his kindnesses during my visits. Yes, I really DIDN'T want to do the
story since it would be a simple slapstick 10-pager and I didn't have
any ideas for it -- it had to show Olympics events, which pretty much
dictated slapstick hijinx and not much else. Furthermore, it forced me
to set a story in 1994, whereas, as you say, MY stories take place in
the mid-50s! In fact, in my first version, I never had the Ducks
actually reach Norway, only compete for the right to "represent
Duckburg", so I was figuring that the story was taking
place in 1952 (the previous Norway Olympics). But then the editors
decided (as they should) that I should show Lillehammer, so from then on
I was cooked.
<P> It was an "imaginary story". I never really happened. That may
be another reason its American publication was of little interest to
me... I see it as a fictitious fiction.

<hr />

<P> I checked my own photocopies, and I'll be danged if there
wasn't a lil' Lemming with a Locket. I had completely forgotten I'd
stuck him in there! I must have done it as an afterthought while
inking (which is when I stick in sometimes what I think are the
funniest bits), and therefore forgot all about it -- though that's
still odd since I did that story so recently. I guess the main
reason is that I really didn't like doing that tale much, and blotted
everything about it from my memory.

<H2><A HREF="#">D 93227</A> (Lo$ 10),
    "The Invader of Fort Duckburg"</H2>
The founding of Duckburg: between my "His Majesty McDuck" and
part 10 of "The Life of $crooge", I tell pretty much the entire (Rosa)
version of the history of Duckburg. The only facts that Barks ever
mentioned about Duckburg is that it was founded by Cornelius Coot and
in 1961 there was a centennial celebration. I took this to mean that
the city was not "incorporated" until many years after it was
"founded"... or not until Calisota became a state? I have $crooge
arrive in 1903, and Duckburg is still only about 3 shacks by then.
Barks also stated that $crooge's bin is on the site of Fort Duckburg,
which I also weave into my series.

<hr />

<P> In many ways, it's my favorite chapter of the series! It is
jam-packed with Barks references, it has such a great cast of
interesting characters, it ties up so many aspects of the series
past and future, and it really moves at a lightning speed with several
things going on at all times. I wish I could get all my stuff to work
out like this.

<hr />

<P> I've decided I'll redraw those central battleships when
Gladstone reprints this chapter. I have lotsa time since they won't get
close to it until August 1995! The battleships were drawn with great
pains to make them accurate to 1902, and I was happy to see the
colorists in Europe go to the trouble of following my coloring
directions (American battleships wore lovely colors in those days)...
but I was so carried away with the authenticity that I forgot that the
ships were being viewed from atop a tall hill! I drew them as if viewed
from sea-level. Notice the ships at the sides are drawn with at least
the proper perspective.

    "The Empire Builder from Calisota"</H2>
Speaking of Bombie and any ideas that I'm revising ANY Barks
Duck-fact, I managed to use everything in "Voodoo Hoodoo" verbatim
EXCEPT the stuff about $crooge's African experiences taking place
"75 years ago"; that was pretty goofy even for Barks to have said
back in the original issue -- $crooge would have had to have been at
least 100 years old in "Voodoo Hoodoo". Anyway, I change the time
frame to 1906, which would be about 50 years ago in my timescape.

<hr />

<P> Disney refused to allow Gladstone to reprint the "Voodoo
Hoodoo" story until the art was altered, and when it was Disney
adopted that version as the "official" version for all future
reprintings. I had the dilemma of how to depict the characters from
that story when I dealt with Foola Zoola and Bombie in my chapter 11.
I was told that if I didn't draw the character's lips and noses as
they were shown in the Gladstone books, my story could not be used.
And even if I did draw it in the 1949 style, it wouldn't match any
other uses of the story, certainly none in America since 1949 and
none in any other country for a loooong while, so it would be sorta
pointless.

<hr />

<P> In part 11 of the "Life of $crooge" series I begin the story
with a map which, if you compare the coastline with a map, PINPOINTS
Duckburg. My comic world and the actual world are identical EXCEPT...
the section of California north of the 39th parallel is Calisota...
that's north of the angle in the coast at Point Arena...north of that
other angle at Lake Tahoe... north of where the Ponderosa was at
Lake Tahoe. On the bay opposite Eureka is Duckburg on the Tulebug
river (and right now I can't recall if there IS a river there which
I renamed or if I just dug a fresh one). As with the years the
stories take place, I don't show this CLEARLY... you'd hafta get
out an atlas and locate the coastline yourself... but that's where
MY Duckburg is. Any reference Donald ever made to South Burbank or
Catalina or anything else... I simply ignore.
<P> There can't be a city as big as Duckburg in that area... and
if there were, it couldn't SNOW there. And don't anybody tell me it
doesn't snow in Eureka -- I don't wanna know that. (Anyway, I guess
I've eliminated the existance of Eureka and all the Eurekans anyway...
because of $crooge's development of Duckburg, Eureka was never
settled or it died out.)

<hr />

<P> Yes, when I laid out the ground to be covered in each Lo$
chapter, I KNEW #11 was gonna be murder! I had set $crooge up in
business as a tycoon, but there wasn't much of anything that needed to
be said about his life between 1902 and 1947 ("Bear Mountain"). There
were lots of Barks references that would be included in those 45 years,
but how to tie everything into a PLOT to last that long and in so FEW
pages!?!? I originally figured I had no choice but to SKIP the whole
Bombie bit, partly because of Disney's ultra-politically-correct
attitudes, and partly because that ancient Barks story had too many
inconsistancies with his own later version of that character, both in
his physical appearance and in his villainous ways. Then I decided that
THAT was the only interesting thing to try to hang a slim plot on,
since I never want to introduce anything altogether NEW to the whole
legend. It was STILL maddening to make sense of the physical appearance
that $crooge had in "Voodoo Hoodoo"'s flashback, and how to string some
idea through most of 45 years. It was really a catch-all chapter which
had to be done if I was to complete the project of including EVERY Barks
reference into the series without leaving out a single one... and I
finally did so.

<hr />

<P> PART 2 - page 1: YOW -- I drew $crooge with TWO pairs of glasses
in panel 4! How could I spend such endless hours on those pages and not
see that till now?

<hr />

<P> The "official" Egmont title to Lo$ #11 is "The Richest Duck in
the World". Sometimes Byron and I don't quite agree on everything, but
he's the boss; he chose that as the title for #11 and the title for #12
will be "The Recluse of McDuck Mansion". If I ultimately decide I don't
like those titles, I'll suggest others to Gladstone and see what they
think when it comes time for them to reprint them. "TRDitW" has a very
special ring to it, and I wanted that as the title of the final chapter;
my title for #11 was "The Empire-Builder from Calisota".

<H2><A HREF="#">D 93488</A> (Lo$ 12),
    "The Recluse of McDuck Mansion"</H2>
I show $crooge becoming increasingly bitter and ornery until
part 12 at which point he is the decrepit old wretch retired to that
mansion... the "Bear Mountain" $crooge. In part 11 I show that he's so
vile and nasty that his family disowns him (that's why we've never seen
Hortense or Matilda, who are probably dead by now anyhow). In part 12 it
will be his first meeting with Donald and HD&amp;L which change his life in
a manner that I have not set to paper yet.

<hr />

<P> The entire story takes place on Christmas Day, 1947. I knew
the European editors would change it, but the sign on the TV store (on
the page where you see that Donald &amp; HDL have been watching the opening
sequence on TV) is supposed to say "SALE! Closeout on 1947 model TVs!"

<hr />

<P> Perhaps in 1 1/2 years when Gladstone gets around to that
chapter, I'll do them an extra 4 or 5 pages of action to stick into
the tale.
<P> I was forced to decide on how to draw $crooge, balancing
his whiskers and glasses between how Barks drew them in CoBM, and how
they MUST look at the end of my series (the "classic" $crooge outfit
and appearance). This is just one of the many decisions I was
forced to make in dealing with the discrepancies in Barks' most ancient
"facts", and I handled them as best I could.

<H2><A HREF="#">D 93574</A>, "The Duck Who Never Was"</H2>
When I started writing &amp; drawing Duck stories in 1987, I
learned by copying Barks poses, as is or with any changes as suited
my needs. As time went on, I relied on them less... and while doing
the Lo$ for the past 2 1/2 years, I haven't used my clip-files at
all. However, as a result of a Danish newspaper article about me
that, though being generally very favorable, claimed I draw Donald
so poorly as to be unrecognizeable, I have gone BACK to using my
clip-file for the "60th Birthday" story I'm currently drawing.

<hr />

<P> Please excuse the artists who gave the Electric [Grandma's car]
exhaust fumes. I just used the Electric in my "Donald Duck 60th
Birthday" story, and quickly found that there's no other way to show
that the Electric is moving unless there's a little puff behind it,
since it moves far too slow to show motion lines. I can claim that it's
a dust cloud? Also, the only sound a creaky old car can make is "chug
chug"; to use an electric hum would be very distracting to readers
and confusing to the 99% of them who have no idea that's an electric car.

<H3>About the Gladstone version</H3>
In my script, no one in the story is supposed to actually say
"It's a wonderful life"... they're supposed to keep dancing around it,
and DD is supposed to START to say it but interrupt himself when he sees
the surprise party. The letterer must not have understood my frequent
use of an ellipsis in my script (for an interruption in mid-sentence),
and was kind enough to complete Donald's sentence for him.
<P> In one panel there is a totally EMPTY word balloon at the bottom
which the letterer didn't seem to see. He put the intended line into
the balloon above, but left the lower balloon void.
<P> In the family-tree that Gus Goose chalks out on the brick wall,
I went to great pains to make it quite accurate, and left room for the
letterer to write in the two names which were needed for that
discussion... $crooge and Gus. But even though the script showed the
proper placement, and even though common sense would tell you that
$crooge is older than Gus, and even though a blind guy woulda' had a
50-50 chance of labelling it correctly, this letterer got it
bass-ackwards.
<P> Finally, the story is built around a key gag involving DD
writing his date of birth down in a personnel file which somebody then
misreads; and the whole issue is scheduled and built on the fact that
June 9 is DD's birthday. Well, this letterer has DD writing into the
file that he is born on the 6th day of the 9th month. September 6th. And
everyone will figure *I* made that unbelievable bone-head error. @#$!!

<H2><A HREF="#">D 94012</A>, "The treasury of Croesus"</H2>
I did an adventure I've had in my notes for 8 years -- the
search for the treasury of Croesus, arguably the most famous treasure
that $crooge never found (but one that even Barks showed him longing for
'way back in "Back to Long Ago"); my result was a fairly good but not
spectacular story with LOTS of research and accuracy and that
needlessly complex art that makes me wonder more and more if it's all
WORTH it -- it took me 2 or 3 weeks longer than it should have!

<hr />

<P> I placed that display of Croesus' treasure in the museum in "The
Son of the Sun" for two reasons. First, I had something different in
that panel which Byron had me remove, though I can't recall why he
didn't like it -- I had a freezer with a window in it showing it
contained the Bombastium ball. To fill the emptied panel I stuck in a
treasure that I planned to do a story about. Was there a reference for
it? In "Back to Long Ago" $crooge daydreams of the two greatest
treasures of antiquity that he hoped to find -- King Solomon's Mines and
the Treasury of Croesus. He never found the second one. But really,
after waiting 8 years, I wish I'd done a better story -- mine is okay,
but no "Son of the Sun".



<H2><A NAME="journey">Journey to the Center of the Earth (yet unpublished)</A></H2>
I'm doing a story that I've had in my head ever since 1959
when I saw "Journey to the Center of the Earth". I've done versions
of this adventure with my own characters as long ago as 1960 (with
worldwide distribution being somewhat less than I enjoy currently --
in those days it was distributed throughout my bedroom with a total
readership of one). In fact I hafta go to the University of Louisville
to do research -- among other scientific problems I need to find
sensible solutions to are how the Ducks can travel through the molten
outer core, withstand the heat and (more significantly) the air
pressure which should squash them to puree... and, also, why
the #$&amp;%* they want to be down there.

<H2><A NAME="soncovers">covers US 219 and GGI 4, "The son of the sun"</A></H2>
There were two different covers for "The Son of the Sun", but

That cover to UNCLE $CROOGE ADVENTURES #5 was the ONLY one of
my own covers that I liked so much that I kept it and I still carry it
with me to conventions for show. But as for the COLORING -- the printers
wouldn't cooperate with Gladstone when it came to coloring that cover,
and you never saw it as I intended it. In fact, you've never seen the
entire art for the cover -- in the background I had drawn an elaborate
Aurora Boraelis which was supposed to mix with a dark, starry night at
the top, with the sun rising behind $crooge and his whole body in
dramatic backlighting; you can still see a trace of that backlighting in
the way I did his coat, and perhaps in that weird blue smudge on his
face which was a puzzling, halfhearted remnant of that complex original
idea.

Disney insisted that Donald, $crooge &amp; Mickey could not be interacting so
I had to always use them in abstract manners. #8 had HD&amp;L in a museum
looking at full-length portraits of the three, each portrait's frame was
characteristic of the subject, and each portrait had a signature of
either C.B. or F.G. in the artist's handwriting style (if that cover had
been or ever will be used, we knew Disney will not allow those signatures
to remain).

<H2><A NAME="us262cover">cover US 262, "Return to Xanadu"</A></H2>
The "Return to Xanadu" cover was used correctly in America. They
flipped it in Europe, I assume because there is no comic there where
$crooge is the title character and I had $crooge on the left side of the
cover where the main character should be (as in the direction we read).

<hr />

<P> Disney wanted to put my name on the cover of the issue that
reprinted "Return to Xanadu", but I said that I would decline having
my name on a cover before Barks had his name on a cover. I think Barks
and I shared that honor of being the first people to get cover credits
on a Disney comic on UNCLE $CROOGE #275, when I wasn't looking (unless
I'm mistaken).

<H2><A NAME="us263cover">cover US 263, "Treasure under Glass"</A></H2>
The cover for the "Treasure Under Glass" story was used NOWHERE
as I drew it. They didn't mirror it in Europe, but deleted the
background. It was mirrored in America to get the chest out from under
the UPC code.

<H2><A NAME="dda23cover">cover DDA 23, Andold wild Duck and the Vikings</A></H2>
The Donald vs. Vikings story that Gladstone is reprinting is
actually a dream sequence of DD imagining the adventures of some
other duck... NOT himself. I have now had the "honor" of drawing the
only DD and the only U$ covers ("Back to Long Ago") that do NOT show
DD or U$, but look-alikes.

<H2><A NAME="los1cover">cover Lo$ 1</A></H2>
Speaking of Disney revisionism: how about that cover? Notice
that the suit of armor on the horse is not ablaze as in the story? The
original version of the cover had the blazing armor, but Disney ruled
that was "too disturbing" for young children. That's irritating, but
they did have a point that time -- if one did not know, as in the story,
that the armor was empty, it would look like a man burning to death, I
s'pose.

<H2><A NAME="los2cover">covers Lo$ 2 (Mississippi boat)</A></H2>
The German albums, BEING albums, will use 2 or 3 chapters of
Lo$ in each issue. They took my suggestion for a cover scene... which
was an almost exact copy (in my style) of the Dutch cover to that
story.
[...]
That German album will also contain part 1 (the riverboat
stuff being in part 2). I'll only be doing one cover based on part 1,
but, yes, there will be a Gladstone cover based on that riverboat
chapter also. Now, normally, Gladstone could just have free useage
of my German cover... but the Germans won't be publishing until
around April or so (it's probably not yet set) and Gladstone will
need a cover BEFORE that.
<P> Since they cannot use the German cover before the Germans do,
I need to do ANOTHER version for Gladstone which will be the EXACT
same scene. Why not? I try to pick the best scene in the story for
the cover, so why do a bad cover for Gladstone instead of the same
good scene? I'm only lucky that I get to do the same idea twice and
get paid twice, the sort of good deal that virtually NEVER happens
in this Disney stuff.

<hr />

<P> The Beagle Boys on the [Gladstone] cover should NOT have their
prison numbers. But I thought readers would find them more
recognizeable, especially at that distance, if they looked completely
like the modern BB's, particularly since they would not yet have read
the interior tale to know the BB's aren't supposed to have numbers at
that point. Artistic license.

<H2><A NAME="los3cover">cover Lo$ 3</A></H2>
I do research out the wazoo when I do a story, but what sort
of research would I do when I draw a cover? I just pick a scene from
the story (mine or Barks') and depict it as it was. Well, but I just
yesterday did a cover for the German "Don Rosa Library" for part
3 &amp; 4 of the Lo$ with $crooge rootin' &amp; tootin' across a desert, and
I did get out some books to draw accurate cacti, gila monsters,
kangaroo rats, roadrunners, horses, sagebrush, rocks....... yeah,
maybe I DO do research on covers.

<H2><A NAME="60cover">cover (Donald's 60th birthday)</A></H2>
I just sent Byron a "Donald's 60th Birthday" album cover for
use in Germany; it features the expected scene of all the Duckburg
characters saluting DD.

<H2><A NAME="lillehammercover">cover Lillehammer, for Norway</A></H2>
Gladstone wanted me to do a cover for their use, but I passed
for 3 reasons: I preferred doing the cover to "The Money Well" issue of
U$A, I didn't want to spoil the string of Talliaferro covers, and
(mainly) I didn't like that story that much and didn't want to draw much
attention to it as being the first of my stories to be used in a year or
more. Later, NORWAY requested I do a special cover, they being the
country that requested that story in the first place, and I have trouble
refusing to do something for the Norwegian editor who has been so very
nice to me.

<hr />

<P> As to the overlapping skis, I DO recall that problem: I drew the
characters first, then found the problem of fitting their long skis in
between the short distance between DD &amp; HDL. At one point, I almost
decided the only answer was to put them all on ONE pair of skis... but
then why would DD be looking back with surprise? So I finally decided to
just squeeze them in there as best I could and hope no one would notice
how jammed up they were.

<H2><A NAME="donaldistkongress">Drawing for the 1992 "Donaldist Kongress" in Germany</A></H2>
It's very embarrassing in that I drew Gladstone Gander's EYES
wrong, something I can't explain!!!

<H2><A NAME="familytree">Donald Duck Family Tree</A></H2>
I think I mentioned that I considered Barks' old privately
done Family Tree, but changed parts and I think "improved" on it...
all done with the help of other Duck fans and Mr. Barks himself. I'm
using Della as the name of Donald's sister. That was the original,
first used, even though it was in the newspaper strip which I regard
as a different "Donald Duck" than the comic book version. Still,
the name Thelma came from nowhere, and didn't go as well with "Duck".

<hr />

<P> As for Gladstone's relation to $crooge, "Race to the South Seas"
IS the story to go to... but only partially, as Barks made an ERROR in
that story in explaining who Gladstone was to $crooge. Barks pointed
this out to me himself when I was quizzing him while building my
"official" Family Tree. The line in that story of Gladstone being
the son of $crooge's sister's sister-in-law is the accurate one. I
can't recall what the second phrase was in the story... something about
$crooge being somebody's brother or such... but it is clearly
contradictory to the previous line and should be ignored.

<hr />

<P> And what other changes did I make in Barks old Family Tree? The
only other one I can think of is that I
eliminated 
the business of
Gladstone's parents dying from overeating at a free picnic, so he
was never adopted by $crooge's sister Matilda. I saw no purpose
behind such a "plot twist" which would have been very hard to get
included in a comic book. Unfortunately, this left Matilda an "old
maid"; I wanted to have her married to Ludwig Von Drake; I like Ludwig
and that would be the ONLY way he could actually be a relative of
Donald. But I was vetoed by everyone from Bob Foster to Carl
Barks on that one... so poor Matilda is still an old maid. (Actually,
she'd be DEAD by now, anyhow. $crooge is the last McDuck alive.)

<hr />

<P> I originally had Fanny as Grandma's sister. Byron didn't
like the idea of Gus Goose being of the same generation of ducks as
Donald's father and of $crooge McDuck.

<hr />

<H2>Cover for the Norwegian "Aftenposten"</H2>
I drew that cover for the large interior article about Scrooge
and me and that "Life of $crooge" series -- they told me that it was
like doing the cover of TIME in America, AFTENPOSTEN is that big in
Norway. Who noze.
<P> Anyway, what the cover is showing is sort of an "imaginary
scene" of the young $crooge seeing a copy of that newspaper and dreaming
of moving to Norway... part of the thrust of the article is how popular
the Ducks are in Norway/Scandanavia, and that the characters seem
to "belong" to that part of the world now, more than any other.
What the old $crooge is looking at is the Oslo City Hall, a VERY
recognizable structure to a Norwegeian, done up like a "dual" Money
Bin. It's a gag that would be lost on anyone outside of Oslo.
