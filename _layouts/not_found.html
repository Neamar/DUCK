<p class="lead">You'll find here all the pictures for which we were unable to find the D.U.C.K dedication.</p>

<p>
  For all we know, this could be because the dedication was removed due to inking, coloring or other printing constraints.<br />
  Or it might be super hard to find in a low-quality scan.<br />
  Or it might be super obvious to you!
<p>

<p>But if you're willing to search, and you get lucky, drop me an email at <tt>duck@neamar.fr</tt> and I'll update those pages! (I'm also interested if you have higher resolution scans)</p>

<p>Happy hunting!</p>
