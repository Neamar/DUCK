    Most Don Rosa stories have the letters D.U.C.K. hidden somewhere in the first panel.<br />
    This is an acronym for <em>Dedicated to Unca Carl from Keno</em>.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>
    Because Disney would not allow for personal signatures in the comics, and thought that D.U.C.K. looked too much like one, Don Rosa has made a habit of hiding the letters in various unlikely places.<br />
    This website lists most of Rosa's covers and first pages, and provides a way to display the dedication in most of them.<br />
    In some cases, <a href="{% link dedication_not_found.md %}">we were unable to find the D.U.C.K. dedication</a>. If you find one that isn't listed on this website, please send an email at <tt>duck@neamar.fr</tt>.<br />
    Good hunt!
