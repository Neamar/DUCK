"Cash Flow" is an Uncle Scrooge-adventure comic written and drawn by Don Rosa from 1987 and first of his stories where the Beagle Boys appeared. Like some others comic stories by Don Rosa (such as [A Matter of Some Gravity](/DUCK/a_matter_of_some_gravity) and [The Universal Solvent](/DUCK/the_universal_solvent)) that story is founded in toying with laws of nature. Rosa thinks that he has got ideas for those comics from mechanical engineering course of institute of higher education, which he took before he became to professional cartoonist.
