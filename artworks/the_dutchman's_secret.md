The Dutchman's Secret is a 1999 Donald Duck comic story by Don Rosa. It is a direct sequel to his 1998 story " [The Vigilante of Pizen Bluff]({% link artworks/chapter_06b_-_the_vigilante_of_pizen_bluff.md %})" and is one of his most historically accurate stories.

Donald's sharp eyesight when deciphering Peralta's markings is a reference to Rosa's earlier story, "[An Eye for Detail]({% link artworks/an_eye_for_detail.md %})".
