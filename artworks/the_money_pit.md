"The Money Pit" is a Donald Duck comic story written and drawn by Don Rosa. It is a sequel to the Carl Barks story "The Trouble with Dimes", and also notably the only story Don Rosa wrote directly for Disney Comics (his later stories that got printed by Disney Comics were written after he joined Guthenberghus).
