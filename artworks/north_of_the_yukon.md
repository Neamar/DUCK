North of the Yukon is a 24-page funny animal comic book adventure story featuring Scrooge McDuck and his nephews. It was written and drawn by Carl Barks.

Don Rosa, who considered Carl Barks his greatest idol, did a cover for Uncle Scrooge #278, depicting a reenactment of the scene on the ice with Scrooge and Barko (the story was reprinted in this issue, as well). Rosa also referenced the events of North of the Yukon in [Chapter 8]({% link artworks/chapter_08_-_king_of_the_klondike.md %}) and [Chapter 9]({% link artworks/chapter_09_-_the_billionaire_of_dismal_downs.md %}) of his Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck anthology.
