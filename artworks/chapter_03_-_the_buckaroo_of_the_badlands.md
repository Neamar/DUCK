"The Buckaroo of the Badlands" is a Scrooge McDuck comic by Don Rosa. It is the third of the original 12 chapters in the series "The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck". The story takes place in 1882. Fifteen-year-old Scrooge is traveling to the American West by train. During a conversation with a man who owns some square eggs the train is robbed by Jesse James and his gang. Scrooge fights them, but falls off the train himself. He comes across some cowboys led by Murdo MacKenzie, transporting cattle and joins them, receiving his own horse, which he names after his sister Hortense, since they have the same bad temper.
