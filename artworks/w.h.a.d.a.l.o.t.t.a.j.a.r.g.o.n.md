"W.H.A.D.A.L.O.T.T.A.J.A.R.G.O.N." is a 1997 Donald Duck story by Don Rosa. This story was originally made to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Huey, Dewey and Louie's first appearance in a newspaper comic strip drawn by Al Taliaferro.

The story's title can be read as *whada lotta jargon* (what a lot of jargon), but is also an acronym that stands for **W**hen **H**uey **A**nd **D**ewey **A**nd **L**ouie **O**riginally **T**hought **T**o **A**dopt **J**unior-**W**oodchuck **A**ttitudes, **R**egulations, and **G**randiose **O**rganizational **N**omenclature.
