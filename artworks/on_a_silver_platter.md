Rosa mentions that he finds this story particularly funny because Scrooge and Magica engage in full-scale combat without either of them ever leaving their home. It was only after Rosa completed and published this story that he learned his old mentor Carl Barks had used a similar concept of a teleportation device in his 1961 story Stranger than Fiction, published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories issue #249.
