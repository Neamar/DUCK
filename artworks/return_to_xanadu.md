    comment: "Don Rosa says this about this D.U.C.K. dedication: 'As to the hidden D.U.C.K. in this new PICSOU pin-up: the D., U., & K. are okay, just as I drew them. BUT... the (excellent) colorist must not know about the hidden dedication because she seems to have added lines to the art to close up areas to contain the color... in other words, she completed purposely-incomplete lines... therefore the C. is no longer there. You'll see where it was supposed to be when you spot the other letters, but don't expect to see the C.'"
