"The Quest for Kalevala" is an Uncle Scrooge comic book story written and drawn by Keno Don Rosa in 1999.

The Quest for Kalevala is based on the Finnish national epic Kalevala, assembled and partly written by Elias LÃ¶nnrot in the 19th century. Rosa's inspiration for the story was a Finnish children's book called Koirien Kalevala ("The Canine Kalevala") by the Finnish cartoonist Mauri Kunnas, who was himself inspired by the original Kalevala.

Part of the story takes place in Helsinki, Finland, depicted in an accurate, realistic way as the city looked in the 1950s, though some buildings pictured weren't built until the 1960s.
