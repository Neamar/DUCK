"The Old Castle's Other Secret", alternately titled "A Letter From Home", is Don Rosa's sequel to "[The Crown of the Crusader Kings]({% link artworks/the_crown_of_the_crusader_kings.md %})". The title is a reference to "The Old Castle's Secret", which was the second story to feature Scrooge McDuck and was the first in which he was a starring character in an adventure with his nephews.
