"The Universal Solvent" is a 1995 Donald Duck story by Don Rosa. The story was inspired by the novel A Journey to the Center of the Earth and was based on a Pertwillaby Papers adventure titled Vortex.

It was also likely a partial sequel of the classic Carl Barks story, "Land Beneath the Ground!".

Don Rosa wrote two sequels to this story, called  "[The Black Knight]({% link artworks/the_black_knight.md %})" and "[The Black Knight Glorps Again]({% link artworks/the_black_knight_glorps_again.md %})".
